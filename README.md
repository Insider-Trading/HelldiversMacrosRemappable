# Helldivers Remappable Macros

This is a fork of [Helldivers Remappable Macros](https://github.com/goncaloestrelado/HelldiversMacro) that adds support for **key remapping**.

## Features

- **Remappable Keys**: Don't have a numpad? No problem. Double-click any slot to bind it to any key on your keyboard.
- **Drag & Drop**: Assign Stratagems by dragging them from the list to your chosen keys.
- **Instant Call**: Execute complex Stratagem codes with a single button press.

## Usage

1. **Launch** the application.
2. **Remap Keys**: Double-click (or middle-click) any slot in the grid to enter recording mode, then press the key you want to use.
3. **Assign Stratagems**: Drag Stratagems from the sidebar into your slots.
4. **Enable Macros**: Check the box at the bottom or use the tray icon.

### Note: Be sure to not have your assigned keys binded to other conflicting actions in-game.

## Credits

- **Original Project**: [Helldivers Numpad Macros](https://github.com/goncaloestrelado/HelldiversMacro) by [goncaloestrelado](https://github.com/goncaloestrelado).
- **Remappable Fork**: Developed to provide accessibility for players without a full numpad.

## Privacy and Security

This app uses a global keyboard hook to detect numpad presses for macros.
It does not record keystrokes, store typed text, or send data over the network.
Macros can be enabled or disabled from the UI and the system tray.
